**Technical Design Document: Task Manager Application**

**1. Introduction:**
   The Technical Design Document outlines the architecture, components, and technologies to be used in the development of the Task Manager Application. This document provides guidance to developers on how different parts of the system will be implemented and integrated.

**2. Architecture Overview:**
   The Task Manager Application will follow a client-server architecture, with the frontend implemented using Angular and the backend using Node.js with Express.js. MongoDB will be used as the database management system for storing user and task data.

**3. Frontend Design:**
   - **Framework:** Angular will be used as the frontend framework for building the user interface.
   - **User Interface Components:** Angular Material will be utilized to design the user interface components for consistency and responsiveness.
   - **Routing:** Angular's built-in routing module will be used for navigation between different views/pages of the application.
   - **State Management:** Angular services and observables will be employed for managing application state and data flow.

**4. Backend Design:**
   - **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js will be used for developing the backend REST API.
   - **API Endpoints:** RESTful API endpoints will be implemented to handle CRUD operations for users and tasks.
   - **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used for user authentication and authorization.
   - **Data Validation:** Express.js middleware will be employed for validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
   - **Database Integration:** MongoDB will be used as the NoSQL database to store user and task data. Mongoose ORM will be utilized for interacting with MongoDB from Node.js.

**5. Database Schema:**
   - **Users Collection:**
     - UserID (Primary Key)
     - Username
     - Email
     - Password (encrypted)
     - Registration Date
   - **Tasks Collection:**
     - TaskID (Primary Key)
     - UserID (Foreign Key referencing Users collection)
     - Title
     - Description
     - Due Date
     - Status
     - Category
     - Created Date

**6. Deployment Strategy:**
   - The frontend Angular application will be compiled into static files and served using a web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
   - The backend Node.js application will be deployed on a server environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).
   - MongoDB will be hosted on a cloud-based database service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) or on-premises server.

**7. Testing Strategy:**
   - Unit tests will be written for frontend and backend components using testing frameworks such as Jasmine and Mocha.
   - Integration tests will be conducted to ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend components.
   - End-to-end testing will be performed to validate the application's functionality from a user's perspective.

**8. Version Control:**
   - Git will be used for version control, with GitHub or GitLab as the remote repository.
   - Feature branching and pull request workflows will be adopted for collaborative development and code review.

**9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - CI/CD pipelines will be implemented using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automating build, test, and deployment processes.
   - Automated tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and reliability.

**10. Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana will be used to monitor application performance, resource utilization, and error rates.
   - Logging libraries like Winston or Bunyan will be employed for logging application events and errors.

**11. Security Considerations:**
   - Data encryption (HTTPS) will be enforced to secure communication between the client and server.
   - Input validation and sanitization will be implemented to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
   - Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms will be in place to protect user data and resources.

**12. Conclusion:**
   The Technical Design Document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, components, and technologies to be used in the development of the Task Manager Application. It serves as a roadmap for developers to implement the application according to the specified requirements and best practices.
